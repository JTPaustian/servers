# servers

McDermott-Group public repository that stores LabRAD servers and some other non-measurement related code.

This repository holds the LabRAD servers used and/or created by the McDermott Lab at UWâ€”Madison (Physics). Proper credit should go to those in the Martinis group at UCSB for their development of LabRAD, PyLabRAD and the core LabRAD servers. Indeed, some of the files here were taken directly from their code, and sometimes edited slightly to fit our needs.
