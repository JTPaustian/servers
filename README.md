# servers

McDermott-Group public repository that stores LabRAD servers and some other non-measurement related code.

This repository holds the LabRAD servers used and/or created by the McDermott Lab at UWâ€”Madison (Physics). Proper credit should go to those in the Martinis group at UCSB for their development of [LabRAD](https://github.com/labrad), [pylabrad](https://github.com/labrad/pylabrad) and the core [LabRAD servers](https://github.com/martinisgroup/servers). Indeed, some of the files here were taken directly from their code, and sometimes edited slightly to fit our needs.
