TODO LIST
- &&& means todo in code
- figure out fridge settings
- do we want to have a recording checkbox with a time interval?
- try running some of this from dif computers
- what happens when close server when client is open?  especially with the menu, buttons, status

BUGS
- mag up buttons when adr server is not active don’t change back properly
- since current lags voltage, often will mag all the way down.  have to press regulate again to go back up
- uses lots of memory
- error when start adr client halfway through adr server initialization:
	Unhandled error in message listener: MessageContext(source=1, ID=(0L,0L), target=102,) ($L, ('message',False)) ((function <lambda> at 0x0482345>, (), {})
- client throws error when tries to load temps for first time and file does not exist (if first time starting it)
- if ADRserver is ended, reg/mag up buttons dont reset

QUESTIONS
- why does the refreshing on a gpib added message not work?
- is it possible to overwrite an existing @setting? ==> yes, but method name and id need to be same
