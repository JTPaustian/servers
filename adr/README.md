The client facing website part of the adr controller is in the "web" repository.  This also requires SSL certificates, which are in Z://mcdermott-group/ssl_certificates.  These need to be created for each new computer.  Digicert allows a user to create a a CSR file, which is submitted to a certifyer.  We used the UW one.  We can then download a SK#7, import it into digicert, and export the needed .key and .crt files.
