# Leiden mView GUI
## Up and Running
### Step 1: Start LabVIEW
In order to monitor the Leiden DR temperature, we must have the LabVIEW executable working. Here is how:
1. Physically unplug the USB plug connecting the computer to the Leiden DR rack controller.
2. Start the LabVIEW virtual instrument that records the temperatures and controls the heaters (```TC.vi```).
3. Plug the USB back into the computer.

### Step 2: Start Necessary Servers and GUI
Navigate to ```..\area51\startup``` and run ```startup.py```.

### Step 3: Have a great time
