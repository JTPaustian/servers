# Leiden mView GUI
## Up and Running
### Step 1: Start LabVIEW on the Laptop
In order to monitor the Leiden DR temperature, we must have the LabVIEW executable (```TC.vi```) working on the laptop. (If you experience a very long delay starting the program, you may have to plug and unplug the USB plug connecting the computer to the Leiden DR rack current source. However, in order to operate the heaters the USB plug to the corrent source should be connected to the desktop and another copy of ```TC.vi``` should be running there.)

### Step 2: Start Necessary Servers and GUI on the Desktop
Navigate to ```..\area51\startup``` and run ```startup.py```.

### Step 3: Have a great time
